# Accessible carousel boiilerplates

Carousels aren't [effective](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding) or [popular](https://erikrunyon.com/2013/01/carousel-interaction-stats/) with real users, but sometimes you just have no choice - managers and clients want what they want! At Accessible360, we've found that carousels almost always have accessibility barriers that range from annoyances to full-blown WCAG violations and blockers. We see this so often, in fact, that we thought it was time somebody did something about it!

In an ideal world, every one of these carousel packages would be improved at their source repositories (and maybe someday they will!), but unfortunately many of them have been abandoned or have such large, ad-hoc communities that making forward progress can be a serious challenge. We believe it's worthwhile to engage in that process, but we also recognize that real-world teams need solutions _now_ so they can pass accessibility audits and improve customer satisfaction and retention.

To help make a difference for end users and developers, we're releasing this set of realistic, ready-to-use code snippets for popular carousel packages that you can start using right now to create more accessible carousels and sliders! So far we have examples for:

* <a href="#accessible-slick">accessible-slick</a>
* <a href="#Flickity">Flickity</a>
* <a href="#Owl-Carousel-2">Owl Carousel 2</a>
* <a href="#Slick-Slider">Slick Slider</a>
* <a href="#Splide">Splide</a>

If you'd like to see snippets for other carousel packages, [please let us know](https://github.com/Accessible360/accessible-carousel-boilerplates/issues)!

## accessible-slick
[accessible-slick](https://github.com/Accessible360/accessible-slick) is a fork of the classic Slick Slider package built by Accessible360 that adds a layer of accessibility improvements to every carousel it's used on. It's designed to be a drop-in replacement for Slick Slider, meaning you can just swap your CDN URLs or hosted files to accessible-slick's and you're good to go! Since practically all of its accessibility improvements are baked right into the package, these code snippets end up being the smallest and simplest.
